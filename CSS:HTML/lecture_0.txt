Lecture 0 - HTML and CSS

HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
Used to describe the text of the webpage

<!DOCTYPE html> 
This tells the web browser what version of html. This particular way is the way of saying this is written using HTML5

<html lang=“en”>
This is the beginning of the html content. </html> is the end. Everything in between is the  html content. ‘lang=“en”’ tells the page is written in English, used for search engines. 

Inside of the html tag of the page:
<head> 
Describes information about the web page. The title for example. <title>Title here</title>

<body>The visible part of the page

Think of the structure of an HTML page as a tree-like structure : the Document Object Model. 

Headings
Ways of visually organizing text on a page
<h1> all the way to <h6>

Lists
Ordered Lists:
1. This
2. Is
3. What it looks like
Needs an <ol> tag, and within <ol></ol> there must be <li> to indicate the individual items

Unordered Lists:
- [ ] For
- [ ] Bulletpoints
Needs an <ul> tag, and the <li> tag within for the indiviudal items

Image
When you display an image, you need to specify what particular image
src is used to link the image
alt is alternative text, which is used if, for whatever reason, the image does not display (or if someone is using a screen reader), then there will be some kind of alternative text that describes the image
Can set size for the image using height and width

Links
<a href> Is used to link pages together
<a href=“https:://www.google.com>Click here</a>
for a link to Google

Table
<table></table> for the entire table
<thead>
Is for the head 
<th> is for table headings
<tbody> is for the body

Form
Anytime a user can provide information, we call that a form

CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
Takes an HTML page and tells the browser how we want it to appear
Fonts, colors, styling
Can be done in a number of ways. using style in the html tag.

You can use the style element:
<style>
        h1 {
            color:blue;
            text-align: center;
        } 
</style>

or you can link to a separate css style, and in the <head> tag, you can do something like this:
<link rel=“stylesheet” href=“styles.css”>

One of the most powerful tools for CSS is to control the size of an element

<div> tag in HTML is like a division of the page, it makes it easier to divide and break up the page and reference it later.

Padding in CSS adds a little bit of space inside of an element
Margin adds space outside of the element

fonts
font-family. You can specify fonts and backups if that font isn’t supported on a browser
Font-size
Font-weight: bold for example

Borders:
You can use borders on elements to add a box like border

When there is a little redundancy (code appearing multiple times), in CSS you can use multiple selectors

th,td {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }


If you have multiple tags of the same type (ex: <h1>), you can select only one of them in the following ways
1. Inline styling in the HTML doc - not the best option
2. You can give headings unique names using ID, and then target that in the css
for example: <h1 id=“foo”>Heading 1</h1>
Then in CSS you would do something like:
#foo {
            color: blue;
        }

You don’t want to add IDs unnecessarily. There should be only 1 ID. If you want to give a unique name to multiple HTML elements, you give them a class.
<h1 class=“cla”>Heading 2</h1>
<h1 class = “cla>Heading 3</h1>

Then in CSS you would do something like:
.cla {
	color: red;
	} 

SpecificityWhen there are multiple ways of selecting an element, by element name, class, ID, there may be conflicts. There is a hierarchy of specificity.

1. Inline
2. ID
3. class
4. type


Selectors
Descendant: Used to select all descendants of an element.
Child: using the > to select the direct children of an element
Attribute selector
Pseudoclass: Under a certain condition, like someone hovering over a link
button {
            width: 200px;
            height: 50px;
            font-size: 24px;
            background-color: green;
        }

        button:hover {
            background-color: orange;
        }

Responsive Design
Viewport
Is it a laptop? Tablet? Phone? 
We ideally want the web page to adapt to different mediums
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

Media Queries
Ways of finetunning how page will look on different types of screens

Flexbox and Grid are two powerful libraries to ensure that we can do responsive design

BootstrapA library containing prewritten CSS 
https://getbootstrap.com
Bootstrap can also be mobile responsive

Sass
Extension of CSS, can include variables. It is a .scss file.
Sass requires compilation to run, as browser understand css and not scss.
