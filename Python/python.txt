Lecture 2 - Python

Variables:
Unlike in C or Java, in Python, you do not need to specify the type of variable. They do have types, you just don’t need to specify.
a = 28				int
b = 1.5				float
c = “Hello!”			str (string)
d = True				bool (requires capitalized True or False)
e = None				NoneType

String concatenation:You can either concatenate using this method:“Here is a string “ + “ and here is another”

Or if you have variables, you can do f strings
name = “Luke”
print(f”Hello {name}”)

individual characters can be accessed by indexing
name = “Brian”
name[0] = “B”

Data Structures:
list = sequence of mutable values
tuple = sequence of immutable values
set - collection of unique values 
dict - collection of key-value pairs

names = ["Spider-Man", "Daredevil", "Luke Cage"]
names[0] = “Spider-Man”
names[0][0] = “S”

Tuples: When you need to store things in pairs for example, (x,y)
coordinate = (10.0, 20.0)

Object Oriented Programming - we think about the world in terms of objects that store information and support the ability to perform operations

def __init__ - the constructor 

self - references the object itself
