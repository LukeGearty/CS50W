Lecture 1 - Git
Git is a way to keep track of changes to code
Allows us to synchronize code between an entire team
Stores a repository online and anytime there are changes made, the server with the files is updated. Test changes to code without committing them.
Can revert back to older versions of the code. 

GitHub - a website that stores repositories (the folder with the code and all the files related to the code)


git clone - a way to take a repository from the internet and put it on your machine
git clone <url>
Methods of authentication: HTTPS, or SSH

git commit - takes a snapshot of the current state
git add - adds a file so that it is added to be tracked

git add <file name>

git commit -m “you can include a message in this commit. It is helpful for keeping track of what you did”

git status - tells you what is currently happening in the repository

git push - whatever changes are made are pushed to GitHub

git pull - take the changes that currently exist on github and pulls it down to your machine

Merge Conflicts
When trying to merge two different sets of changes. There needs to be some kind of way to resolve them.
Every commit gets a hash to identify the commit

git log - logged for every commit, useful to see who added what

Branching - working on different parts of the repository at the same time

git branch - to see all the branches

git checkout -b <branch name> - to create a new branch
